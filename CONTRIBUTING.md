## Issues

- If your issue was closed but the problem persists, comment `/reopen` on it — as the original author, this reopens the issue automatically (GitHub itself doesn't let authors reopen maintainer-closed issues). Issues closed as *not planned* are a maintainer call and aren't reopened this way, but a comment is still welcome.

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused (one theme per PR)
- Include a short test plan (commands you ran)
- All tests must pass before merging

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before your first pull request can be merged, you need to sign our
[Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md). It is a one-time, automated step: the
CLA Assistant bot comments on your PR, and you sign by replying:

> I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA

The CLA keeps agentflare MIT-licensed for everyone while allowing the maintainer
to relicense (e.g. for a hosted/commercial offering).
